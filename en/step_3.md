## Plan your card 💌

Use this step to plan your card. You can plan by just thinking, adding backdrops and sprites in Scratch, or drawing or writing — or however you like!

Open the [World Environment Day starter project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1004459944/editor/){:target="_blank"}. Scratch will open in another browser tab.

⏱️ Not much time? You can start from one of the [examples](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/35028571){:target="_blank"}.

Use your new Scratch project to plan your card. You don't have to add all the sprites and sounds now you can add more later. 

You can also use ✏️ a pencil and a piece of paper to sketch your ideas.

Think about the backdrop and sprites:
- 🖼️ Which backdrop or background colours will you use in your card? 
- 🗒️ What will your message look or sound like?
- 🦁 Which characters and objects will you have in your card? 
- 🏃‍♀️ Will the sprites be animated with movement or graphic effects
- 👉 Will your audience interact with your card?
- 🔉 Will your card have sound?
