## You will make

Create a digital card 💌 to send to someone for World Environment Day.

World Environment Day is celebrated by the United Nations every year on 5 June. It has been celebrated since 1973. It is a day to encourage people to think about the environment and take action to protect it.

Once you have made your card, your Code Club can choose their favourite card to share with another Code Club in the UK, and receive a card in return!
Your card could be about the environment in your local area, or about an environmental issue that you care about. You could also think of your own idea.


You will:

+ Create a digital card for someone about your chosen topic
+ Choose which skills to use to make your card
+ Share a web address for your card
