## Your idea 💡

We are celebrating World Environment Day together! What does the environment mean to you? Decide the theme of your card and who you will make your card for.

A <span style="color: #0faeb0">**digital (or paperless) card**</span> 💌📲  is a card created and read on a computer, tablet, phone, or other electronic device.

🎉 Digital cards are being used for celebrations worldwide. They are better for the environment than sending paper cards. ❓ Can you think of reasons why?

### Why are you making the card?

The idea for this project is to send a message to someone to let them know about something that is important to you. 

--- task ---

Think about the purpose of your card. 

It could be:
- 🚲 A showcase of your school’s green initiative
- 🎂 A celebration of 51 years of World Environment Day
- 🏡 A story about your local area
- 🦌 Information about your favourite animal or plant
- ♻️ An important message about recycling or waste reduction
- Or something else!

**IMPORTANT** Remember not to include any personal information like your name or address in the card. This is to keep you safe. Never share any personal information online.

### Who is it for?

--- task ---

Think about who you will make your card for (your **audience**).

Your Code Club is invited to choose their favourite digital card to share with another Code Club, and receive a card in return! That way you can share what is important to you and you can learn about what is important to other young people.

You can also share your project with other people, for example:

- 👧 A friend
- 👴 A family member
- 👩‍🎓 A school class 
- 👩‍💼 A politician 
- Or someone else
